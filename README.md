# Valor
A reimagination of Bravery mode for Monster Sanctuary.

I dislike Bravery mode because the monsters you get in your chest are not truly random, they are tied to the area of the chest. This means that for example the Underworld chest can only give you a monster that spawns in the Underworld.
Randomizer has the problem that it breaks progression too much (get an early Moccus spawn and you can farm Hide+5 and never die, or get an early Mad Lord for infinite Shift Stones), so I don't like that one either.

Valor is a mode on top of Bravery that randomizes monster chests, so they can spawn any monster. There is some logic in place that will guarantee that you can finish the seed, which means beat Mad Lord, access all areas to get the monster chests and beat all champions. Other than that, the monsters you get are random (although, as in vanilla Bravery, Spectrals can only be granted in Eternity's End). I tried to stick to roughly the same progression logic that the devs had in mind, so you cannot start with a monster that has Improved Flying or Swimming. The Caretaker of Sun Palace will still give you a guaranteed swimmer.

# Installation
It's a BepInEx plugin, so you need BepInEx and a ModLoader. I use the one suggested by Evaisa: https://modworkshop.net/mod/30598

Drop the contents into the Monster Sanctuary folder and start the game once. Exit again and then put the Valor.dll into Monster Sanctuary/BepInEx/plugins.

To start a Valor run, select Bravery without Randomizer and start a New Game (New Game+ should work as well, I have not tested it tho). Relics and Permadeath can be chosen freely.
